  "description": "Enable/Disable battery threshold on Lenovo Thinkpad laptops.\n\nIf you mainly use the system with the AC power adapter connected and only use the battery sporadically, you can increase battery life by setting the maximum charge value to less than 100%. This is useful because batteries that are used sporadically have a longer lifespan when kept at less than full charge.",
